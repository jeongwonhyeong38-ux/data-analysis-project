## Processed Data

This project performs data cleaning and feature engineering directly within the analysis notebook.

No processed datasets are stored as separate files to:
- avoid duplication,
- ensure full reproducibility from raw data,
- keep the repository lightweight.

All processing steps can be reproduced by running:
- notebooks/analysis.ipynb
